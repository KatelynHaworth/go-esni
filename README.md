Encrypted Server Name Identifier (ESNI)
=======================================

This library provides supported for handling ESNI DNS records used to present SNI
encryption information to clients.

It has been developed based on the [IEFT ESNI Draft][0], upto draft version 3.

As the ESNI specification is still on a Draft track and hasn't been finalised as a standard,
this library (and the ESNI spec) are **not ready for production use.**
